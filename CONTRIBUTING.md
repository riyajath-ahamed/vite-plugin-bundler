## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vite-plugin-bundler.git
   cd vite-plugin-bundler
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/riyajath-ahamed/vite-plugin-bundler.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Build the package**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards:
   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
   - Ensure backward compatibility when possible

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:run
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. The test suite includes:

- **Unit tests** (`src/__tests__/plugin.test.ts`)
- **Integration tests** (`src/__tests__/integration.test.ts`)
- **Performance tests** (`src/__tests__/performance.test.ts`)
- **Utility tests** (`src/__tests__/utils.test.ts`)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once (no watch mode)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test files
npm test -- --grep "integration"
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Release Process

This project uses a manual release workflow through GitHub Actions.

### Triggering a Release

1. Go to **Actions** → **Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select version bump type (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`)
4. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will automatically:

- Run the full test suite
- Build the package
- Bump the version in `package.json`
- Commit, tag, and push the version change
- Publish the package to npm
- Generate a changelog from commit history since the last tag
- Create a GitHub Release with the changelog and installation instructions

## GitHub Workflows

The project includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Pushes to `main` and pull requests to `main` or `beta`
- **Test job**: Runs on Node.js 18, 20, and 21 — executes linting, type checking, tests, and coverage upload to Codecov
- **Build job**: Builds the package and verifies that `dist/index.js`, `dist/index.mjs`, and `dist/index.d.ts` are produced
- **Security job**: Runs `npm audit` at moderate severity level

### 2. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) with a version bump type selection (`patch` / `minor` / `major`)
- Runs the test suite and builds the package
- Bumps the version, commits, tags, and pushes to `main`
- Publishes to npm
- Generates a changelog from commits since the last tag and creates a GitHub Release

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```bash
feat: add gzip compression support
fix: handle edge case in file filtering
docs: update README with new examples
chore: bump version to 1.1.0
```

### Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:
```bash
feat!: redesign plugin API

BREAKING CHANGE: The plugin configuration API has been redesigned
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Provide a detailed description of changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

4. **Wait for review**:
   - All CI checks must pass
   - At least one maintainer must approve
   - Address any requested changes

5. **Merge**:
   - Use "Squash and merge" for most PRs
   - Use "Merge commit" for complex features with multiple commits

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use appropriate error types
- Log errors when necessary

### Performance
- Consider performance implications
- Use streaming for large files
- Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- Add performance tests for critical paths

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Use deprecation warnings for breaking changes
- Document migration paths
- Version breaking changes appropriately

## Getting Help

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions and general discussion
- **Documentation**: Check the README.md for usage examples
